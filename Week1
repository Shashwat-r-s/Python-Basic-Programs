GrPA 1: Accept five words as input and print the sentence formed by these words after adding a space between consecutive words and a full stop at the end.
Solution code:
word1 = input()
word2 = input()
word3 = input()
word4 = input()
word5 = input()
space = ' '
stop = '.'
sentence = word1 + space + word2 + space + word3 + space + word4 + space + word5 + stop
print(sentence)

GrPA 2: Accept the date in DD-MM-YYYY format as input and print the year as output.
Solution code:
date = input()
year = date[-4: ]
print(year)


GrPA 3: Accept a sequence of five single digit numbers separated by commas as input. Print the product of all five numbers.
Solution code:
num = input()
d1 = int(num[0])
d2 = int(num[2])
d3 = int(num[4])
d4 = int(num[6])
d5 = int(num[8])
dprod = d1 * d2 * d3 * d4 * d5
print(dprod)

GrPA 4:Assume that several institute start offering degrees across multiple branches. The email-id of a student is defined as follows:
branch_degree_year_roll@student.degree.institute.ac.in
For example, if the email-id is CS_BT_21_7412@student.degree.institute.ac.in,
then this student is from the computer science branch, pursuing a BTech degree from institute, starting from the year 2021, with 7412 as the roll number. branch,
degree and year are codes of length two, while roll and institute are codes of length four.
Accept a student's email-id as input and print the following details, one item on each line:
(1) Branch
(2) Degree
(3) Year
(4) Roll number
(5) Institute
Solution code:
email = input()
branch = email[:2]
degree = email[3: 5]
year = email[6:8]
roll = email[9:13]
institute = email[-10:-6]
print(branch)
print(degree)
print(year)
print(roll)
print(institute)

GrPA 5: Accept two positive integers x and y as input. Print the number of digits in xy. You should be able to solve this problem using the concepts covered in week-1.
Solution code:
x = int(input())
y = int(input())
res = x ** y
res_str = str(res)
print(len(res_str))

GrPA 6:Accept two positive integers M and N as input. There are two cases to consider:
(1) If M < N, then print M as output.
(2) If M >= N, subtract N from M. Call the difference M1. If M1 >= N, then subtract N from M1 and call the difference M2. 
Keep doing this operation until you reach a value k, such that, Mk < N. 
You have to print the value of Mk as output.
Solution code:
m = int(input())
n = int(input())
print(m%n)
